this is about html :
HTML pages are text documents.
HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
Tags are often referred to as elements.
Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
Attributes require a name and a value.
To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
You can add comments to your code between the
markers.
The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.

The

and elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

The tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.

Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple

elements).
Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

This is the Main Heading
This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.

This is a Sub-Heading
Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings).

Another Sub-Heading
Here you can see another sub-heading.

---------------------------------------- When the element is used inside an element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. For example, a pullquote or glossary might be considered as an aside to the article it relates to. When the element is used outside of an element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page. For example, it might contain links to other sections of the site, a list of recent posts, a search box, or recent tweets by the author.

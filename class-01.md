Chapter 1:
Structure
what we mean here in stucture ? to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to it is very important to understand how to structure documents

useing headings give us an overview of things we want to know which here is the general structure and subheadings then subheadings than a paragraph or more for each subtitle this give us overview of the structure of this thing in the web .

Body, Head & Title and what al this means in html

and how you can Creating a Web Page on a Mac Looking at How Other sites are Built When the web was first taking off, one of the most common ways to learn about HTML and discover new tips and techniques was to look at the source code that made up web pages.

Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element. XX Attributes require a name and a value.

XX To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
chapter 8
Extra Markup
in the begininning the writer talks here the versions of html since the founding of the web and what are the versions and some propblems in the old version as there the latest version of html 5 and the defferences between it and html 4 and that even the use of advanced techniques ther are some proplems in some tag and not everyone can forword with all tha tag and updates made by html.

The examples in this book all follow these strict rules of XML. One of the key benefits of this change was that XHTML works seamlessly with other programs that are written to create and process XML documents.

and talk about thatDespite the fact that HTML5 is not yet completed, you can safely take advantage of the new features of the language as long as you endeavour to ensure that users with older browsers will be able to view your pages (even though some of the extra features

the writer also talked about the most important features that are used in the new html and how you can use thim with a simple explanation

chapter 17
HTML5 Layout
in this chapter we will talk about html5 with a new set of elemants that html5 will proved. also this new alements will be an important role in creating wep pages and how they can provide useful alternatives and how old browsers can learn about updates.
the diffrent between old <div and in the html5 :

web page authors used <div elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div element in the structure of the page.

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for: ●● The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site. ●● A header or footer for an individual <article> or

within the page. * so we see here the new elements in html5 provid the abilty to control all parts of the web page and are more specific than the old elements . # chapter 18 : It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return. Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site. Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page. Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them. You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style. You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present. # a b c brogramming * Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript you shold to know that : * you must first plan the big picture of the topic and then you have to break down the big picture into several steps by first setting the goal of the task that you want to achive and you can think about that as a dilemma that must be solved through the computer and then you have to design the text that you want and that throgh dividing tasks by outline and writing down the steps that you wont to start through and you have to writing down step that you wont to start through and you have to write the code for each step in the programming language file . it is good to spend time desingning the script you want before starting to write it. * And here we have the steps to write the code after you have written all the steps in a diagram that the computer can understand. You must understand the words you use in the computer. You must also learn and understand how to combine words together. Art in order to create code with learning and focus in the language you want to use * Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help) # RULES FOR NAMING # VARIABLES what we learen here : 1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($) or (_). 2. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. * what is An array ? t is a type of variable that stores a list of variables, not just one value, and it is very useful when you create a file that contains many values ​​and variables, and you will not face a problem in that. * It is important to know that array and the values ​​in it are numbered starting from zero, not a single number. This thing is done automatically and is called the index. Here we also learn how to retrieve a file and also each array has a property called the length that carries the number of the array elements. this the end .
# this is about html :
* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
 * Tags are often referred to as elements.
 * Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
 * Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
 * Attributes require a name and a value.
 * To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.
  * The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
 * It's important to understand w XX ho your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
  # this is about java cript :
  * javaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   1. HTML to define the content of web pages

   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages
   4. A B C of programming :
A-What is a script and how do I create one? 
B-How do computers fit in with the world around them?
C-How do I write a script for a  web page?
Once you have learned the basics, the fo llowing chapters will show how the JavaScript
language can be used to tell browsers what you want them to do.
  <html>
<body>
<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
the page. And if the page is a long one it might
be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
<h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
<p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
you follow the structure of what is being written.
There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
headings).</p>
<h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
<p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
</body>
</html>
----------------------------------------
When the <aside> element
is used inside an <article>
element, it should contain
information that is related to the
article but not essential to its
overall meaning. For example, a
pullquote or glossary might be
considered as an aside to the
article it relates to.
When the <aside> element is
used outside of an <article>
element, it acts as a container
for content that is related to
the entire page. For example,
it might contain links to other
sections of the site, a list of
recent posts, a search box, or
recent tweets by the author.
